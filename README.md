# PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and firmware demonstration project (FPGA logic)

Built using the Xilinx toolchain/toolsuite.  
Should also be portable to other ZYNQ XC7Z020 compatible boards.  

## Purpose

What does it do?  
Wires up various switches, buttons and LEDs on the PYNQ-Z2 board (ZYNQ XC7Z020).  
Demonstrates the basics of creating a project using scripting.  
The I/O connections are hardwired in the FPGA project.

Start by reading the project [documentation](./docs/docs.md)  
or follow the [walkthrough](./docs/walkthrough/walkthrough.md)

Once deployed, pressing a button on the PYNQ-Z2 board will light the corresponding LED
